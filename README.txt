I have developed full stack application meeting all the requirements.

WEBSITE URL :
GITHUB URL :


mongodb username:user
        password:user123 

*****TECH STACKS USED ****
FRONT END - REACTJS,HTML,CSS,REDUX
BACKEND   -  NODEJS,EXPRESS,MONGODB

***FUNCTIONALITIES***
--> I have created 9 users . Users who are candidates can edit their form,
    other users who are not candidates just have the functionality to vote 
    as specified in the requirements. 
--> USERNAME: user1,user2,user3...........user9  (9 users)   
    PASSWORD: password

--> 2 ADMINS which have functionalities of adding,deleting,
    voting for a candidate.
--> USERNAME: admin1,admin2
    PASSWORD: password

--> JWT authentication implemented where user needs to login using username and password.
--> End users can also signup as admin(for testing purposes) or user.

--> On logging in ,user will see the names of all candidates 
    and on clicking them ,their attributes can be viewed.

--> I have changed Admin1's voting status as voted just to point out
    difference.Once a user has voted ,the voting button gets disabled 
    so that user cannot vote again. 

--> Login as both user and admin to see their functionalities (recommended)
